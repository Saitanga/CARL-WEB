        <p>"HUMSS" stands for Humanities and Social Sciences. It is an academic strand or track in some high school and senior high school systems, particularly in the Philippines. The HUMSS strand is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of various disciplines within the humanities and social sciences, including but not limited to subjects like literature, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, psychology, political science, economics, and history. Students who choose the HUMSS strand often have an interest in exploring human behavior, societies, cultures, and historical events. The strand is geared towards developing critical thinking, research, and communication skills, preparing students for diverse career paths in fields such as education, journalism, law, social work, and public administration.</p>
