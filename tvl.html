        <p>"TVL" stands for Technical-Vocational-Livelihood. It is an academic strand or track in some high school and senior high school systems, particularly in the Philippines. The TVL strand is designed to provide students with practical skills and knowledge for specific trades or vocations, preparing them for employment or entrepreneurship after completing their studies. The curriculum includes a mix of academic and technical subjects, with a focus on developing skills relevant to various industries such as agriculture, automotive, electronics, information technology, tourism, hospitality, and other vocational fields. TVL aims to equip students with the practical know-how and hands-on experience needed for immediate entry into the workforce or for further technical education and training. This strand is an alternative for students who have a preference for a more hands-on and skill-oriented approach to learning.</p>
